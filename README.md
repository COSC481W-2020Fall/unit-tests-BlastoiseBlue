Functionalities that require unit tests:
1. [ ] Connect to database
2. [x] Import data into database
3. [ ] Country search bar (This will require JavaScript tests, as well as perhaps Selenium)

Functionalities that do not require tests:
1. Graph generation specifics (not exactly something that can be tested for programmatically, aside from testing if the resulting string is empty)
2. Database centralization (aside from determining whether or not the database exists, we can't entirely test that multiple machines are looking at the same database.)
